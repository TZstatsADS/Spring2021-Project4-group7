+ Project summary: 
In this project,our goal is to compare Regression Estimate, Stratification, and Weighted Regression where PS is based on L2 penalized logistic regression.

We implement and evaluate these three causal inference algorithms on treatment datasets (low dimensional/ high dimensional).

Performances : ATE estimation, Running Time, absolute error are used to evaluate and compare the efficiency of the causal inference algorithms.
