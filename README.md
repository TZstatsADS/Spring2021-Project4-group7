+ Project summary: 

In this project,our goal is to compare Regression Estimate, Stratification, and Weighted Regression where PS is based on L2 penalized logistic regression. We implement and evaluate these three causal inference algorithms on treatment datasets (low dimensional/ high dimensional). ATE estimation, Running Time, absolute error are used to evaluate and compare the performance and computational efficiency of the causal inference algorithms.
	
**Contribution statement**: All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement. All team members attended all weekly meetings.

+ Daizy Lam: 

+ Qiao Li: managed communications; **L2 penalized logistic regression**, Contributed to presenatation, Github ReadMes,Edited final report 

+ Chuanchuan Liu: 

+ Yingyao Wu:  Researched and implemented stratification—included brief explanation of the logic behind the algorithm and walked through the implementation step by step. Responsible for the model comparison section—created tables and graphs to compare results from the three algorithms. Organized and cleaned up the Rmd file.

+ Serena Yuan: Worked on the Weighted regression algorithm and on thresholds that give optimal ATE for weighted regression algorithm. Read most of the articles and helped to add discussion and summaries to the final document. Attended all meetings.
